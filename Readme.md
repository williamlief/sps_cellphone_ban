Two SPS middle schools, Robert Eagle Staff and Hamilton International, have banned cell phones during the school day and are using locking pouches.  [SPS District News 'Cellphone Policy Catching on with Students, Parents](https://www.seattleschools.org/news/away-for-the-day-cellphone-policy-catching-on-with-students-parents/), [Seattle Times, "Banned from school? Teens Picture Life without cellphones](https://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/teens-feel-stressed-as-schools-tighten-cellphone-bans/)

This project is a study of the impact of this pouch policy on students' perceptions of being at school. It uses data from the [SPS School Climate Surveys](https://www.seattleschools.org/departments/rea/district-surveys/) to compare changes in student responses at Robert Eagle Staff and Hamilton to responses at other SPS middle schools.
